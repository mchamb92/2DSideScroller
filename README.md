- Task 4: Create simple movement for the first weapon.
-	The movement of rotation was completed for the fireball subsequently by my third task. So, the Task 4 branch was not moved to 'complete' during this sprint.
-	The task was still completed, but I will use the branch to update the movement even further to project forward form the main character sprite.
